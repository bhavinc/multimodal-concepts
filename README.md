A repo that will be updated soon. Stay tuned.

Code to reproduce the results presented in the SVRHM Workshop (NeurIPS 2021) paper ['Multimodal neural networks better explain multivoxel patterns in the hippocampus'](https://openreview.net/forum?id=6dymbuga7nL).

The requirements/dependencies are mentioned in `requirements.txt`.
