# mutlimodal-concepts

Code to reproduce the results presented in the SVRHM Workshop (NeurIPS 2021) paper ['Multimodal neural networks better explain multivoxel patterns in the hippocampus'](https://openreview.net/forum?id=6dymbuga7nL).

The requirements/dependencies are mentioned in `requirements.txt`.

`kamitani_utils.py` demonstrates how to use the beta files (obtained after GLM) and the latent representations of the images (obtained from models). You can adapt this file as per your requirements.
